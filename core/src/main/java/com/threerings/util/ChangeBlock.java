/**
 * A simple mechanism for preventing infinite recursion when one change listener responds to an
 * event by making another change, which in turns notifies another (or the same) listener, which
 * makes another change, and so on.  The following example demonstrates the pattern:
 *
 * <p><pre>
 * public void stateChanged (ChangeEvent event)
 * {
 *     if (!_block.enter()) {
 *         return;
 *     }
 *     try {
 *         // do something that may cause another state change
 *     } finally {
 *         _block.leave();
 *     }
 * }
 * </pre>
